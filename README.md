## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

```html
<div class="card__image">
  <div class="card__image--color"></div>
</div>
```

```css
.card__image {
  position: relative;
  width: 100%;
  height: 320px;
  background-image: url("./images/image-header-mobile.jpg");
  background-position: center;
  background-size: cover;
  border-radius: 8px 8px 0 0;
}

@media (min-width: 800px) {
  .card {
    width: 85%;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: row-reverse;
  }
}
```

### Continued development

I definitely need to work and study more on image containers. I'm having trouble accommodating them in different sizes.

### Useful resources

I used the [guide of challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/stats-preview-card-component-8JqbgoU62) found on Frontend Mentors website. Only that.
